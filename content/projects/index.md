# Projects

A selection of work that reflects how I think, build, and structure systems.

## [EasySave — Backup Tool](/projects/easysave/)

**Stack:** C#, .NET, WPF, MVVM

[GitHub](https://github.com/ntino67/FISE_A3_SE_ENGEL_Axel)

A desktop backup application developed with production standards in mind.

- Multiple backup jobs with configurable settings
- Logging, progress tracking, and clean separation via MVVM
- Encryption through an external CLI tool (CryptoSoft)
- Thoughtful UI design using WPF and data binding

This project was an exercise in architecture, clarity, and real-world constraints.

## [AI What-If — Health Risk Explorer](/projects/ai-whatif/)

**Stack:** R, plumber, Random Forest, React, TypeScript, Docker/Podman

This is a close source project but you can access the website [here](https://aiwhatif.nightingaleheart.com/)

A complete system for exploring heart-disease risk and generating actionable lifestyle changes.

- Random Forest model trained on cleaned, transformed health data
- R API exposing prediction and counterfactual generation
- React front-end for form inputs, interactive results, and visualizations
- Containerized environment for reproducible builds and deployment
- Handles validation, transformation, and interpretation of user input

This project taught me how to bridge statistical modeling, web APIs, and modern front-end workflows.

## [Static Site Generator](/projects/static-site-generator/)

**Stack:** Python

[GitHub](https://github.com/ntino67/static-site-generator)

The custom tool used to build this portfolio.

- Markdown parsing (headings, paragraphs, code, quotes, lists)
- Inline formatting (bold, italic, code spans)
- HTML tree construction and template injection
- Clean, incremental build process
- Minimal by design—transparent and easy to extend

Built to understand the internals of SSGs and to keep full control over my personal site.

## [Asteroids](/projects/asteroids/)

**Stack:** Python

[GitHub](https://github.com/ntino67/asteroids)

Arcade-style Asteroids remake built to practice clean game-loop structure, entity design, and collision handling.

- Player ship with rotation, thrust, inertia, and screen wrap
- Randomized asteroids with physics and breakup logic
- Bullet system with collision resolution
- Predictable update/render loop
- Simple, readable architecture focused on behavior over graphics

A small project that teaches the fundamentals of interactive systems and real-time state management.
