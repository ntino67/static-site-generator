# Matteo Heidelberger

Back-end–oriented software engineering student, building small, sharp tools and reliable systems.

I like clean abstractions, simple stacks, and code that is easy to reason about years later.

I really like to learn a lot and use Obsidian to compile what I'm working on.

You can visit my blog if you are curious about what I'm learning/doing at the moment.

## What I do

- Design and implement back-end services and APIs
- Work with containers, Linux, and CI to ship small apps
- Build internal tools that remove friction for developers

**Current focus**

- Back-end engineering in Go, Python, and C#
- Data-heavy apps and automation
- Learning Rust by building low-level tools

## Selected projects

- **EasySave – Backup Tool**  
  C#/.NET backup application with WPF UI, encryption via an external CLI, logging, and job scheduling.  
  Treats a school assignment like a real product: clear architecture, MVVM, and maintainability.

- **Static Site Generator**  
  Python-based tool that parses Markdown and outputs this portfolio as a static site.  
  Minimal by design, easy to extend, and tailored to how I like to work.

- **Asteroids**
  Python-based game that is directly inspired by the game Asteroids.
  I used this project to solidify my OOP abilities. I can work on it further.

## Now

- Finishing my computer science degree at CESI
- Refining my tooling, editor setup, and workflows
- Looking for internships and roles around back-end development, tooling, or infrastructure
