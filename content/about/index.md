# About

I’m Matteo Heidelberger, a computer science student focusing on back-end engineering, developer tooling, and clean software design.

I prefer **small, understandable systems** over complicated stacks.  
If something can be expressed with a few clear modules, that’s the path I take.

## Background

I’ve worked on projects involving:

- **C#, .NET, WPF, MVVM** → building production-style desktop apps ([EasySave](/projects/easysave/))
- **R, plumber, Random Forests** → designing health-risk predictors and counterfactual engines ([AI What-If](/projects/ai-whatif))
- **React, TypeScript** → front-end integration with statistical back-ends
- **Containers, Linux, CI** → reproducible environments and simple deployment
- **Git and structured workflows** → clean commit histories, automation scripts, modular repos

I study at CESI Strasbourg, where I focus on software engineering, system design, and building real tools rather than academic prototypes.

## How I work

- I write **modular code**, not massive files.
- I want **clarity first**, optimization second. I believe that good naming can prevent the use of comments. Leading to a easier code to maintain.
- I use **tests, automation, and consistent patterns** to avoid surprises later.
- I’m comfortable taking ambiguous requirements and reducing them to something implementable.
- I track design, decisions, and architecture as part of the codebase.

My goal is to make the system predictable for anyone reading it—including future me.

## Outside of code

I like structured learning: finance, training, writing, tools, and workflows.

I'm interested in entrepreneurship and I practice a lot of sports such as Volleyball and Badminton.

I build systems for myself the same way I build software: minimal, deliberate, and scalable.

This portfolio—built with my own static site generator is part of that mindset.
