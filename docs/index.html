  C#/.NET backup application with WPF UI, encryption via an external CLI, logging, and job scheduling.  
  Treats a school assignment like a real product: clear architecture, MVVM, and maintainability.</p><p>- <b>Static Site Generator</b>  
  Python-based tool that parses Markdown and outputs this portfolio as a static site.  
  Minimal by design, easy to extend, and tailored to how I like to work.</p><p>- <b>Asteroids</b>
  Python-based game that is directly inspired by the game Asteroids.
  I used this project to solidify my OOP abilities. I can work on it further.</p><p>More details on the <a href="/static-site-generator/projects/">Projects</a> page.</p><hr></hr><h2>Now</h2><ul><li>Finishing my computer science degree at CESI</li><li>Refining my tooling, editor setup, and workflows</li><li>Looking for internships and roles around back-end development, tooling, or infrastructure</li></ul><p>If this matches what you are building, go to the <a href="/static-site-generator/contact/">Contact</a> page.</p></div></main>
