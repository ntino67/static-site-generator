      <main class="article"><div><h1>About</h1><p>I’m Matteo Heidelberger, a computer science student focusing on back-end engineering, developer tooling, and clean software design.</p><p>I prefer <b>small, understandable systems</b> over complicated stacks.  
If something can be expressed with a few clear modules, that’s the path I take.</p><hr></hr><h2>Background</h2><p>I’ve worked on projects involving:</p><ul><li><b>C#, .NET, WPF, MVVM</b> → building production-style desktop apps (<a href="/static-site-generator/projects/easysave/">EasySave</a>)</li><li><b>R, plumber, Random Forests</b> → designing health-risk predictors and counterfactual engines (<a href="/static-site-generator/projects/ai-whatif">AI What-If</a>)</li><li><b>React, TypeScript</b> → front-end integration with statistical back-ends</li><li><b>Containers, Linux, CI</b> → reproducible environments and simple deployment</li><li><b>Git and structured workflows</b> → clean commit histories, automation scripts, modular repos</li></ul><p>I study at CESI Strasbourg, where I focus on software engineering, system design, and building real tools rather than academic prototypes.</p><hr></hr><h2>How I work</h2><ul><li>I write <b>modular code</b>, not massive files.</li><li>I want <b>clarity first</b>, optimization second. I believe that good naming can prevent the use of comments. Leading to a easier code to maintain.</li><li>I use <b>tests, automation, and consistent patterns</b> to avoid surprises later.</li><li>I’m comfortable taking ambiguous requirements and reducing them to something implementable.</li><li>I track design, decisions, and architecture as part of the codebase.</li></ul><p>My goal is to make the system predictable for anyone reading it—including future me.</p><hr></hr><h2>Outside of code</h2><p>I like structured learning: finance, training, writing, tools, and workflows.</p><p>I'm interested in entrepreneurship and I practice a lot of sports such as Volleyball and Badminton.</p><p>I build systems for myself the same way I build software: minimal, deliberate, and scalable.</p><p>This portfolio—built with my own static site generator is part of that mindset.</p><p>If you want to see what I’ve built, go to the <a href="/static-site-generator/projects/">Projects</a> page.</p></div></main>
